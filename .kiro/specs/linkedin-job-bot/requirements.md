# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a LinkedIn job application automation bot built with Node.js and Puppeteer. The system is designed to help professionals efficiently apply to multiple job postings on LinkedIn by automating the application process, form filling, and job search filtering. The bot focuses on "Easy Apply" positions and includes intelligent features to avoid duplicates, handle CAPTCHAs, and maintain detailed logs of all activities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want the bot to automatically search and apply to LinkedIn jobs with "Easy Apply" functionality, so that I can save time and increase my application volume.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bot starts THEN the system SHALL only target job postings that have the "Easy Apply" button available
2. WHEN a job posting requires external application THEN the system SHALL skip that posting and log the reason
3. WHEN the bot finds an Easy Apply job THEN the system SHALL automatically click the apply button and proceed with the application process
4. IF a job posting has already been applied to THEN the system SHALL skip it and mark it as duplicate in the logs

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want to configure search parameters including location, keywords, date range, and remote work options, so that I can target relevant job opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user configures search parameters THEN the system SHALL accept location, keywords, date of publication, and remote work preferences
2. WHEN performing a search THEN the system SHALL apply all configured filters to LinkedIn's search interface
3. WHEN no jobs match the criteria THEN the system SHALL log the result and terminate gracefully
4. IF search parameters are invalid THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and prevent execution

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want the bot to automatically fill out application forms with my information, so that I don't have to manually complete repetitive forms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an application form appears THEN the system SHALL automatically fill experience-related fields with pre-configured data
2. WHEN salary expectation fields are present THEN the system SHALL input the configured salary range
3. WHEN common application questions appear THEN the system SHALL provide pre-configured answers from the configuration file
4. IF a form field cannot be automatically filled THEN the system SHALL log the field type and continue with available information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want the bot to handle CAPTCHA challenges appropriately, so that my account remains secure and compliant with LinkedIn's terms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a CAPTCHA is detected THEN the system SHALL pause execution and notify the user
2. WHEN waiting for CAPTCHA resolution THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for manual completion
3. WHEN CAPTCHA is resolved THEN the system SHALL automatically resume the application process
4. IF CAPTCHA resolution fails or times out THEN the system SHALL log the failure and continue with the next job posting

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want the bot to maintain a database of applied jobs, so that I can track my applications and avoid duplicates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bot applies to a job THEN the system SHALL store job details in a SQLite database including job ID, title, company, and application date
2. WHEN encountering a job posting THEN the system SHALL check the database to determine if already applied
3. WHEN a duplicate job is found THEN the system SHALL skip the application and update the log
4. IF database operations fail THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue operation without crashing

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to have a modular architecture with TypeScript interfaces, so that the code is maintainable and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing the system THEN the code SHALL follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
2. WHEN organizing code THEN the system SHALL implement barrel exports for clean imports
3. WHEN designing components THEN each module SHALL follow Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
4. WHEN defining data structures THEN the system SHALL use separate TypeScript interfaces for type safety

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want comprehensive logging and error handling, so that I can monitor the bot's performance and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bot performs any action THEN the system SHALL log the activity with timestamp and details
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log the error details and continue operation when possible
3. WHEN the bot session completes THEN the system SHALL provide a summary report of applications submitted
4. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL gracefully shut down and preserve all logged data

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want the bot to use stealth techniques to avoid detection, so that my LinkedIn account remains safe from automated activity restrictions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing the browser THEN the system SHALL use puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth to reduce detection risk
2. WHEN navigating between pages THEN the system SHALL implement random delays to simulate human behavior
3. WHEN interacting with form elements THEN the system SHALL use realistic typing speeds and mouse movements
4. IF detection countermeasures are triggered THEN the system SHALL pause and allow for manual intervention

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want centralized configuration management, so that I can easily customize the bot's behavior without modifying code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the bot THEN all settings SHALL be stored in a config.json file
2. WHEN the bot starts THEN the system SHALL validate all configuration parameters
3. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages and prevent execution
4. IF configuration file is missing THEN the system SHALL create a template configuration file with default values

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want the bot to handle session management and timeouts, so that it can run reliably for extended periods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bot runs for extended periods THEN the system SHALL manage LinkedIn session timeouts appropriately
2. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
3. WHEN LinkedIn requires re-authentication THEN the system SHALL pause and request user intervention
4. IF the session expires THEN the system SHALL attempt to re-authenticate using stored credentials when possible
